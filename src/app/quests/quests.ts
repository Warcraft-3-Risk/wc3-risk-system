			To earn income, you must control an entire country when the turn ends. It’s often best to begin with smaller countries to secure income quickly. Expand carefully and keep your territories connected for stronger defense.  
			
			Use your spawns wisely - they are free units granted each turn from the countries you control.  
			
			Communication is essential in risk - make sure to pay attention to the chat. Diplomacy is key. Make peace with other players when it benefits you, but always be ready for betrayal when you are vulnerable.

			It is also important to include a few Roarers to cast Roar and Dispel.  
			
			Other units serve more specialized purposes:  
			- Knights and Generals are situational, best used to overwhelm your enemy once their riflemen line has collapsed.  
			- Artillery provide long-range splash damage, but are fragile and require protection.  
			- Tanks are powerful when massed. Be sure to pull back weakened tanks so they can recover.  
			
			At sea:  
			- SS dominate the waters and are the primary ship of choice in FFA games.  
			- Warship B excels at chasing down weakened ships, including SS.  
			- Warship A is an early-game vessel, useful mainly in the opening turns along vulnerable coastlines.  
			
			Choose your forces wisely - the right mix will decide the battle.

			There are four Overtime settings:
			1. Turbo Mode: Overtime begins at turn 30, accelerating the game pace early on. This is the default setting.
			2. Medium Mode: Overtime starts at turn 60, allowing for a long gameplay before the mechanic activates.
			3. Extended Mode: Overtime starts at turn 120, allowing for extended gameplay before the mechanic activates.
			4. Off: Overtime is disabled.
			
			If two or more players exceed the city requirement to win while having the exact same number of cities, the game will be extended by additional turns until one player breaks the tie and leads in city count.

			This system ensures flexibility and adaptability based on player preferences.

			You don’t need to supply all three parameters. However, if you want to change the second or third, you must also provide all preceding parameters.  
			To reset your camera to default values, type the command with no parameters.
			
			This example sets your camera to a top-down view with the default rotation and a distance of 5000:
			-cam 5000 90 270  
			-zoom 5000 90 270
